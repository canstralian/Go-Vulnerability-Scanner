# Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). 

We do not tolerate any form of harassment or discriminatory behavior.

All communication and contributions should be respectful and professional. Be kind and considerate to others. Disagreements and constructive criticism are welcome, but avoid personal attacks or derogatory language.

If you experience or witness any violations of this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers.

We will take appropriate measures to address the issue and ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.
